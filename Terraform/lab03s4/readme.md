# Lab03s4 - Terraform Outputs

## Overview
This lab builds upon the infrastructure established in Lab03s3, focusing specifically on implementing Terraform outputs. While Lab03s3 introduced resource tagging, Lab03s4 demonstrates how to use output variables to expose key information about provisioned resources.

## Progression from Previous Labs

### Lab03s1 (Foundation)
- Established core networking components (resource group, VNet, subnets, NSGs)

### Lab03s2 (Basic Compute)
- Added Ubuntu virtual machine deployment with basic configuration

### Lab03s3 (Resource Tagging)
- Implemented comprehensive resource tagging for better resource management

### Lab03s4 (Output Variables)
- Introduces Terraform output variables
- Demonstrates how to expose and display important resource information
- Maintains the same tagged resources from Lab03s3

## Key Concept: Terraform Output Variables

Output variables in Terraform serve as a way to:

1. Extract and expose specific information about resources after deployment
2. Provide important details such as IP addresses, resource IDs, and connection strings
3. Enable integration with other tools and systems
4. Facilitate documentation of deployment results
5. Pass information between Terraform modules

## Common Output Variables for Azure VM Deployments

This lab implements outputs for:
- Public IP address of the virtual machine
- Private IP address of the network interface
- Virtual machine ID
- Connection information for SSH access

## Benefits of Output Variables

1. **Improved Visibility**: Easily view critical information about deployed resources
2. **Better Integration**: Share resource information with other systems and tools
3. **Simplified Troubleshooting**: Quick access to connection information
4. **Enhanced Documentation**: Self-documenting infrastructure with key details exposed
5. **Streamlined Operations**: Facilitates easier access to resources after deployment

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Implementing Terraform output variables
- Extracting important resource attributes
- Formatting output for readability and usability
- Understanding resource attribute references

This lab demonstrates an essential aspect of Terraform usage that improves the usability and documentation of infrastructure deployments.
