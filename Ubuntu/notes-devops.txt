Linux Notes(DevOps):
    - lec 1:
        - What is Linux

    - lec 2:
        - what is linux kernel

    -- lec 4:
        - how to install linux : 1) VM, 2) Virtual Box, 3) cloud, 4) Dual boot
        - check version: cat /etc/issue

    -- lec 5: (connect through ssh)
        - Connect remotely with linux through ssh. secure shell.
        - putty, termius, winscp, mtputty, openssh client
        - the public key is in the authorised keys file and the private key is on the client or the host machine.
        - generate key through puttygen. 
        - save the private key in putty, and the public key in the authorized keys file.

        - Create ssh keypair through linux
            - create ssh key pair: ssh-keygen -t rsa
            - copy the private key to the client machine
            - keep the public key in the authorized keys file
            - however, we also need to change the format of the private key, through puttygen.

    -- lec 6: linux filesystem:
        - linux file system is a collection of files on a disc drive or partition
        - partition is a segment of memory and contains some data. 
            -- / -> root directory
                -- it is the main directory, the umbrella. 
            -- data storage formats Ext 3/Ext 4
                -- Ext stands for extened. 
            -- partition [/dev/sda]
                -- logical volumes. to divide the main drive.
                -- fdisk -l to see the volumes. 
        
        - /bin contains all the command binaries to run different commands. 
        - /boot contains all the things needed for the os to boot
        - /etc contains all the necessary configurations for software that we install. 
        - /media shows the external drives or usb connected
        - /mnt is used t mount a usb or etc. 
        - /opt contains add ons, additional software packages. 
        - /run has runtime info
        - drwxr-xr-x 2 mujeeb mujeeb 4096 Sep 25 15:39 directory
           - The '2' here represents the number of hard links to this directory.
           - To understand hard links and this number:
           - 1. A hard link is a directory entry that points directly to the inode of a file or directory.
           -    - An inode is a data structure that stores all the information about a file except its name and content.
           - 2. Hard links are like additional names for the same data on disk.
           - 3. For directories:
           -    - Every directory has at least 2 hard links:
           -      a) One for its name in the parent directory
           -      b) One for the '.' entry inside itself (referring to itself)
           -    - This number increases for each subdirectory created inside it
           -      (because each subdirectory has a '..' entry pointing back to this parent)
           - 4. A count of 2 for a directory typically means it's empty (no subdirectories)
           - 5. For regular files, this number shows how many different directory entries
           -    (i.e., filenames) point to the same data on the disk
           - Hard links provide a way to have multiple directory entries reference the same file data,
           - saving disk space and allowing for efficient file organization.

        - file permission numbers:
            - rwxrwxrwx
            - x = execute -- 1
            - w = write -- 2
            - wx = write and execute -- 3
            - r = read -- 4
            - rx = read and execute -- 5
            - rw = read and write -- 6 
            - rwx = read, write, and execute -- 7

    -- lec 7: 
        - Reasons for refusal of ssh key
            - The key is not added to the authorized keys file.
            - The key format is not correct
            - The user permissions are not set correctly.
            

    -- lec 8: changing ssh port
        - cd /etc/ssh/sshd_config file
        - change port number
        - Restart the ssh service
        - And make sure to open the port in the firewall if applicable.
    
    -- lec 9: Disable Root user Login
        - nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config file
        - change the line: PermitRootLogin yes to no.
        - restart the ssh service

    -- lec 10: linux ports
        - in linux ports is used to access different network devices and services, when we combine the ip and port number, a socket number is created. 
        - range 0 - 65535
            - 0 - 1023 : reserved for well known services. 
            - 1024 - 49151 : user ports, available for registration
            - 49152 - 65535 : dynamic ports, can be assigned to any service. 

        - common ports:
            - 21 : used for FTP, file transfer protocol.
            - 22 : used for ssh, secure shell.
            - 23 : used for telnet, remote login without encryption
            - 25 : used for SMTP, simple mail transfer protocol
            - 53 : used for DNS, domain name system
            - 67,68 : used for DHCP, dynamic host configuration protocol, 67 for serer and 68 for client
            - 80,443 : 80 -> http, 443 -> https:
            - 110,995 : 110 -> pop3(post office protocol), 995 -> pop3s (secure encrypted)
            - 123 : network time protocol, used for time synchronization
            - 137 : used for netbios, printing and file sharing
            - 143,993 : used for IMAP, internet message access protocol, IMAP(secure) on 993
            - 161,162 : used for SNMP, simple network management protocol, used to send alerts and monitor infrastructure
            - 445 : for SMB, server message block, file sharing as well
            - 465 : secure SMTP, used for secure sending mail
