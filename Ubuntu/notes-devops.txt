Linux Notes:
    - lec 1:
        - What is Linux

    - lec 2:
        - what is linux kernel

    -- lec 4:
        - how to install linux : 1) VM, 2) Virtual Box, 3) cloud, 4) Dual boot
        - check version: cat /etc/issue

    -- lec 5: (connect through ssh)
        - Connect remotely with linux through ssh. secure shell.
        - putty, termius, winscp, mtputty, openssh client
        - the public key is in the authorised keys file and the private key is on the client or the host machine.
        - generate key through puttygen. 
        - save the private key in putty, and the public key in the authorized keys file.

        - Create ssh keypair through linux
            - create ssh key pair: ssh-keygen -t rsa
            - copy the private key to the client machine
            - keep the public key in the authorized keys file
            - however, we also need to change the format of the private key, through puttygen.

    -- lec 6: linux filesystem:
        - linux file system is a collection of files on a disc drive or partition
        - partition is a segment of memory and contains some data. 
            -- / -> root directory
                -- it is the main directory, the umbrella. 
            -- data storage formats Ext 3/Ext 4
                -- Ext stands for extened. 
            -- partition [/dev/sda]
                -- logical volumes. to divide the main drive.
                -- fdisk -l to see the volumes. 
        
        - /bin contains all the command binaries to run different commands. 
        - /boot contains all the things needed for the os to boot
        - /etc contains all the necessary configurations for software that we install. 
        - /media shows the external drives or usb connected
        - /mnt is used t mount a usb or etc. 
        - /opt contains add ons, additional software packages. 
        - /run has runtime info
        - drwxr-xr-x 2 mujeeb mujeeb 4096 Sep 25 15:39 directory
           - The '2' here represents the number of hard links to this directory.
           - To understand hard links and this number:
           - 1. A hard link is a directory entry that points directly to the inode of a file or directory.
           -    - An inode is a data structure that stores all the information about a file except its name and content.
           - 2. Hard links are like additional names for the same data on disk.
           - 3. For directories:
           -    - Every directory has at least 2 hard links:
           -      a) One for its name in the parent directory
           -      b) One for the '.' entry inside itself (referring to itself)
           -    - This number increases for each subdirectory created inside it
           -      (because each subdirectory has a '..' entry pointing back to this parent)
           - 4. A count of 2 for a directory typically means it's empty (no subdirectories)
           - 5. For regular files, this number shows how many different directory entries
           -    (i.e., filenames) point to the same data on the disk
           - Hard links provide a way to have multiple directory entries reference the same file data,
           - saving disk space and allowing for efficient file organization.

        - file permission numbers:
            - rwxrwxrwx
            - x = execute -- 1
            - w = write -- 2
            - wx = write and execute -- 3
            - r = read -- 4
            - rx = read and execute -- 5
            - rw = read and write -- 6 
            - rwx = read, write, and execute -- 7

    -- lec 7: 
        - Reasons for refusal of ssh key
            - The key is not added to the authorized keys file.
            - The key format is not correct
            - The user permissions are not set correctly.
            

    -- lec 8: changing ssh port
        - cd /etc/ssh/sshd_config file
        - change port number
        - Restart the ssh service
        - And make sure to open the port in the firewall if applicable.
    
    -- lec 9: Disable Root user Login
        - nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config file
        - change the line: PermitRootLogin yes to no.
        - restart the ssh service

    -- lec 10: linux ports
        - in linux ports is used to access different network devices and services, when we combine the ip and port number, a socket number is created. 
        - range 0 - 65535

        - SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux):
            - A Linux kernel security module that implements security policies.
            - These policies provide fine-grained access control for processes and files.
            - Enhances system security by defining what actions are allowed or denied.

        - Key SELinux commands:
            - sestatus : to check the current status and mode of SELinux.
            - setenforce 0 : to set SELinux to permissive mode (policies are not enforced, only logged).
            - setenforce 1 : to set SELinux to enforcing mode (policies are actively enforced).
            - getenforce : to display the current SELinux mode (Enforcing, Permissive, or Disabled).
            - /etc/selinux/config : configuration file to set SELinux mode persistently.

        - nslookup : to find the ip address of a domain.
        
        - Links:
            - softlink : a type of file that points to another file or directory. it is a special file that contains the path to the target file or directory. this means that the target file or directory can be accessed through the softlink.

            - hardlink : a type of file that points to the same inode as another file. it is a special file that contains the path to the target file or directory. this means that any change in the hardlink will reflect in the original file and vice versa.

            - ln -s (target) (link name) : to create a softlink.
            - ln (target) (link name) : to create a hardlink.

        - scp (Secure Copy):
          - Used to securely copy files between servers over SSH.
          - Copies entire files each time, even if they haven't changed.
          - Simple to use for one-time file transfers.
          - Examples:
            - scp -r (source) (destination) : Copy recursively
            - scp -P 3022 (source) remoteuser@remote_location:[directory] : Use custom port

        - rsync (Remote Sync):
          - Used to synchronize files and directories between servers.
          - Only transfers the differences between source and destination, saving bandwidth.
          - Offers more features like compression, preservation of file attributes, and exclusion rules.
          - Better for large transfers or regular syncing tasks.
          - Example:
            - rsync -av (source) (destination) : Archive mode, verbose output

        Key differences:
        - Efficiency: rsync is more efficient for repeated transfers or large files.
        - Functionality: rsync offers more advanced features and options.
        - Use case: scp is simpler for quick, one-time transfers; rsync is better for backups or mirroring.
