    CI - continuous integration
        -- Strategy that speeds up development and deployment of a software. A strategy/tool that automates the building of newly commited to ensure the code works.

    CD - continuous delivery/deployment
        -- Deployment V/S Delivery
            -- Deployment is without any manual intervention
            -- Delivery has manual intervention
        -- used to deploy to our production/development/staging environment.
    
    -- We benefit from these automated strategy by making deployment quick and ensuring the code follows industry standards and is tested. 

Lecture - 2:
    - What is a CI/CD pipeline?
        -- Stage 1: 
            - Code commit/checkout: Pipelines are triggered to start the building process automatically as soon as code is commited. 
            - Webhooks are used to create these triggers. Hooks are scripts that allow us to perform actions at certain point in a git workflow. 
            
        -- Stage 2:
            - Code build/compilation:
                -- 1. Compilation of code
                -- 2. Packaging dependencies
                -- 3. Artifact <--> binary
        -- Stage 3:
            - Code Testing: (Generic Steps, each company can have their own testing steps)
                -- 1. Unit Testing: Checks code for errors
                -- 2. Integration Testing: Tests all the components/services/modules to make sure they integrate and work flawlessly. 
        -- Stage 4:
            - Code Packaging: Now we can create a docker image/binary. Docker files are used to create docker images. 
        -- Stage 5:
            - Deploy our executable image to a container:
                -- 1. Image Registry
                -- 2. Authenticate deployment server. 
                -- 3. Than we can pull our image and run it into a container. 
        
Lecture - 3:
    - Github Actions 
        - Example yml file.
            -- name: My Docker Image CI
            -- on: (These are the webhooks or triggers to trigger the pipeline)
                push:
                    branches: ["main"]
                pull_request:
                    branches: ["main"]
            
            -- jobs:
                build:
                    runs-on: ubuntu-latest //github actions runner 
                    steps:
                    - uses: actions/checkout@v4 //when building, this action of checkout is used. 

                    - name: Build the docker image
                      run : docker build . --file Dockerfile --tag my-image-name:$(date +%s)
                    
                    - name: Release of the github actions runner
                      run : |
                        uname -a
                        cat /etc/issue
                        touch abc.txt

        -- The action work on the github workspace, and github workspace is the actions runner workspace github actions creates.
