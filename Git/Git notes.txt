- Lecture 1: Introduction to Git and Github
    - What is Git?
        -- it is a devops tool to track changes in code. 
        -- it is a version control system, it is used to manage code and track changes.
        -- it is also maintains a history of all changes made to a codebase. and allows developers to revert to previous versions of code.
    - Two type of version control systems:
        -- centralized version control system.
        -- distributed version control system.
    - centralized version control system:
        -- The project is located at a single location and all the developers pull the code from the central repository and push the code to the central repository.
        -- It is easy to setup and use.
        -- It is a linear workflow, where the developers have to push the code to the central repository and then the code is merged into the main branch.
        -- It is not suitable for large number of developers.
    - distributed version control system:
        -- The project is located at a single location and all the developers have their own copy of the repository.
        -- It is a non-linear workflow, where the developers can work on the same codebase simultaneously.
        -- It is suitable for large number of developers.
    - Centralized Version Control System Diagram:
        |           Central Repository
        |                   |
        |           /       |       \
        |          /        |        \
        |         /         |         \
        |        /          |          \
        |       /           |           \
        |      /            |            \
        |     /             |             \
        |    /              |              \
        | Dev 1           Dev 2           Dev 3

    - Distributed Version Control System Diagram: 
        |     Central Repository
        |     /      |       \
        |    /       |        \
        |   /        |         \
        |  /         |          \
        | /          |           \
        |/           |            \
        |            |             \
        |   Local    |    Local     |   Local
        |   Repo     |    Repo      |   Repo
        |   Dev 1    |    Dev 2     |   Dev 3

    - Key differences:
        -- In centralized, developers directly interact with the central repository
        -- In distributed, each developer has a full local copy of the repository
        -- Distributed allows for offline work and more flexible branching
        -- Centralized requires constant connection to the central server
   
    - Git vs Github:
        -- git is a version control software tool, github is a service on cloud platform that uses git to store and manage code.
        -- git is a local tool, github is a remote tool.
    
- Lecture 2: How git works?
    - 1. Install git -> apt install git
    - 2. mkdir <folder name> -> to create a new folder
    - 3. cd <folder name> -> to go inside the folder
    - 4. git init -> to initialize the git repository
        -- this creates a hidden folder called .git which stores the metadata of the repository.
        -- And creates a new branch called master.
    - 5. git status -> to check the status of the repo.
    - 6. Make a change to the folder. 
    - 7. git status -> to check the status of the repo.
        -- The file comes as untracked file.
    - 8. git add <file name> -> to add the file to the staging area. 
    - 9. git log -> shows the commit history. 
    - 10. If we edit a file. The file is under modified state, because git is tracking it. 
    - 11. git commit -m "Message" -> to commit the changes. 
    - 12.
